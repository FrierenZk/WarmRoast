WarmRoast
=========

WarmRoast is an easy-to-use CPU sampling tool for JVM applications, but particularly suited for Minecraft servers/clients.

* Adjustable sampling frequency.
* Supports loading MCP mappings for deobfuscating class and method names.
* Web-based â€” perform the profiling on a remote server and view the results in your browser.
 * Collapse and expand nodes to see details.
 * Easily view CPU usage per method at a glance.
 * Hover to highlight all child methods as a group.
 * See the percentage of CPU time for each method relative to its parent methods.
 * Maintains style and function with use of "File -> Save As" (in tested browsers).
 
Java 17 and above is required to use current fork of WarmRoast.

Usage
-----

1. Note the path of your JDK.

2. Download WarmRoast.

3. Replace `PATH_TO_JDK` in the following commands with the path to your JDK and execute the program.

**Note:** The example command line below includes `--thread "Server thread"`, which filters all threads but the main server thread. You can remove it to show all threads.

**Modded/vanilla servers:** If you are using a modded server, get a copy of [MCP](http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Releases) for your server's Minecraft version, copy the files from conf/ somewhere, and point WarmRoast to it with `--mappings path/to/folder`. This helps readability a lot. Bukkit uses its own mapping, so a pure non-modded Bukkit server can't use MCP mappings.

### How to Run ###

    java WarmRoast-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.sk89q.warmroast.WarmRoast --thread "Server thread"

* Or execute this command with thread is set by default to "Server thread"


    java -jar WarmRoast-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
